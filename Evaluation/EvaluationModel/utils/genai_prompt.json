            "Grammar": "AI → Few to no grammar/spelling mistakes; errors are rare but systematic (e.g., factual inaccuracies, awkward phrasing). \n\n Human → Typos, casual punctuation, and occasional unpolished grammar appear naturally.",

            "Emotional Expressiveness": "AI → Tends to stay neutral, polite, or overly formal; emotions are often generic or exaggerated in “safe” ways. \n\n Human → Naturally subjective, with nuanced emotions, sarcasm, frustration, excitement, etc.",
            "Coherence & Natural Transitions": "AI → Overly structured and coherent, sometimes to the point of rigidity. \n\n Human → More flexible, may include digressions, tangents, or abrupt shifts.",
            "Pronouns": "AI → Avoids strong personal pronouns (\"I\", \"me\") unless instructed, keeping a detached tone. \n\n Human → Freely uses “I”, “we”, or “you” to situate writing in a lived perspective.",
            "Contextual Appropriateness": "AI → May apply overly formal/academic tone even in casual contexts; struggles with hyper-local or niche references. \n\n Human → Naturally adjusts tone depending on audience, situation, and familiarity."
