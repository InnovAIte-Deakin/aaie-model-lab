**GenAI Evaluation Prompt**

**Task:** AI Detection Model

**1. Document Description**

This document defines a prompt framework for guiding GenAI to act as a
evaluator. The evaluator's role is to assess whether an AI-detection
model correctly or incorrectly classified a given text as either
*AI-generated* or *Human-written*.

The evaluation task is based on binary classification:

-   Correct Prediction → Model's prediction matches the true
    classification (ground truth).

-   Wrong Prediction → Model's prediction does not match the true
    classification.

By following the criteria and prompts outlined in this document, GenAI
will analyze texts, compare model prediction vs. actual label, and
decide whether the model's output is correct or wrong. This process
ensures a consistent and explainable method for assessing AI-detection
performance.

**2. Prompt description**

**2.1. Role play**

To activate the model, we need to provided a specific role for the model
to work this will help the model to understand who it is so it can
provided a clear result based on instruction.

"You are an evaluator tasked with assessing whether an AI-detection
model made a Correct Prediction or a Wrong Prediction when classifying
text as *AI* or *Human.*\
You must strictly follow the criteria provided and always explain your
reasoning based on these set of criteria."

**2.2. Criteria and Reasoning**

The set of criteria should be provided for the model to reason why the
model prediction is correct or incorrect. The criteria for each type of
writing content will be setted so that the model can follow and provided
the reason why it should be actual label.

1.  Repetition

    -   AI: Often shows unnatural or excessive repetition of
        phrases/structures due to training data patterns.

    -   Human: Usually less repetitive, unless intentional (e.g.,
        emphasis, storytelling).

2.  Lexical Diversity

    -   AI: May recycle common vocabulary and avoid rare/unexpected word
        choices.

    -   Human: Naturally mixes simple and advanced words; sometimes uses
        domain-specific terms or personal slang.

3.  Sentence Structure Diversity

    -   AI: Tends to keep uniform sentence length/complexity (mechanical
        rhythm).

    -   Human: Naturally alternates between short, long, fragmented, and
        casual structures.

4.  Grammar

    -   AI: Few to no grammar/spelling mistakes; errors are rare but
        systematic (e.g., factual inaccuracies, awkward phrasing).

    -   Human: Typos, casual punctuation, and occasional unpolished
        grammar appear naturally.

5.  Content Specificity

    -   AI: Generic, templated, or universal responses without grounding
        in real-life details.

    -   Human: Refers to specific experiences, contexts, places, or
        unique references.

6.  Emotional Expressiveness

    -   AI: Tends to stay neutral, polite, or overly formal; emotions
        are often generic or exaggerated in "safe" ways.

    -   Human: Naturally subjective, with nuanced emotions, sarcasm,
        frustration, excitement, etc.

7.  Coherence & Natural Transitions

    -   AI: Overly structured and coherent, sometimes to the point of
        rigidity.

    -   Human: More flexible, may include digressions, tangents, or
        abrupt shifts.

8.  Pronouns

    -   AI: Avoids strong personal pronouns (\"I\", \"me\") unless
        instructed, keeping a detached tone.

    -   Human: Freely uses "I", "we", or "you" to situate writing in a
        lived perspective.

9.  Contextual Appropriateness

-   AI: May apply overly formal/academic tone even in casual contexts;
    struggles with hyper-local or niche references.

-   Human: Naturally adjusts tone depending on audience, situation, and
    familiarity.

**2.3. Input structure**

The input of the model should followed a clear and detailed structure
where the model can followed and understand. Based on that it can output
some detailed and analyse to give the correct answer.

-   The input of the model should include these information:

-   Text: the input of the model where we need to detect

-   Label: the actual label of the text whether it is AI or Human

-   Prediction: the output from the model whether it is AI of Human

**2.4. Output structure**

Since we input the data into the GenAI Evaluator, it should also
followed a structure output with provided detailed information that we
can use to understand the model.

The output of the evaluator should be included:

-   Result: when comparing between label and prediction, model can
    output *Correct* or *Incorrect*

-   Criteria-based analyse (reasoning): this indicated which criteria
    that the model have followed to anlyse.

-   Confidence_level: this indicate how many percentage that model
    analyse is followed actual label.

**2.5. Example**

> Input:

-   Text:\
    > *\"I started running every morning last month. At first, it was
    > exhausting, but now I feel more energetic and even sleep better.
    > My neighbor John sometimes joins me, and it makes it more fun.\"*

-   Label (Ground Truth): Human

-   Prediction (Model Output): AI

> Output (Evaluator):

-   Result: Wrong Prediction

-   Criteria-based Analysis:

    -   Repetition: No unnatural repetition → matches Human.

    -   Lexical Diversity: Mix of simple and specific words
        > ("exhausting", "energetic", "sleep better", "neighbor John") →
        > Human-like.

    -   Sentence Structure Diversity: Natural variation in sentence
        > length; not uniform → Human.

    -   Grammar: Informal but correct; casual phrasing ("makes it more
        > fun") → Human.

    -   Content Specificity: Concrete details (timeframe "last month",
        > name "John", daily routine) → Human.

    -   Emotional Expressiveness: Subjective ("exhausting", "more fun")
        > → Human.

    -   Coherence & Natural Transitions: Flows conversationally, not
        > rigid → Human.

    -   Pronouns: Frequent personal pronouns ("I", "my") → Human.

    -   Contextual Appropriateness: Tone fits casual context → Human.

-   Confidence_Level: 92% (high confidence it is Human-written).
