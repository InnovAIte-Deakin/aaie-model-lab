# Human Evaluation Rubric: Feedback Generation Task

## Project: AAIE â€“ Artificial Assessment Intelligence for Education
**Task**: Human Evaluation Criteria for Feedback Generation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive evaluation criteria for human raters to assess AI-generated feedback quality. The evaluation uses a 1-5 rating scale with specific criteria for what constitutes excellent, good, average, poor, and unacceptable feedback output.

## Rating Scale Overview

| Rating | Level | Description | Quality Indicator |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **5** | **Excellent** | Outstanding feedback that exceeds expectations | Exceptional quality across all criteria |
| **4** | **Good** | High-quality feedback that meets most expectations | Strong performance with minor areas for improvement |
| **3** | **Average** | Adequate feedback that meets basic requirements | Satisfactory performance with noticeable limitations |
| **2** | **Poor** | Below-average feedback with significant issues | Multiple areas need substantial improvement |
| **1** | **Unacceptable** | Inadequate feedback that fails to meet requirements | Critical failures across multiple criteria |
