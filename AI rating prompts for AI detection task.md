**Objective: AI rating prompts for AI Detection task**

The AI Detection Task is designed to evaluate whether a given text was written by a human or generated by an AI system. The reasoning is based on five dimensions:

- Stylistic Fluency: overly polished compared to natural variation.
- Repetition Patterns: unusual repetition compared to natural flow.
- Specificity: generic text compared to personal or experiential detail
- Complexity Balance: uniform structure compared to varied sentence length
- Topical Coherence – rigid logical flow compared to natural conversational flow

Also, include a Confidence Scale (range from 0 to 100) from Low certainty to Very strong confidence.

*Part 1: Evaluation Rubric:*

The evaluation framework is structured around five key textual features: ( <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343300209_Automatic_Detection_of_Generated_Text_is_Easiest_when_Humans_are_Fooled> )

1. Stylistic Fluency:
- AI text is often highly polished, grammatically perfect, and lacks variation.
- Human text often shows natural variation, minor errors, or idiosyncrasies.
- Scale:
  - Weak fluency: suggests human origin.
  - Overly polished: suggests AI.
1. Repetition Patterns
- AI systems sometimes repeat phrases unnaturally (such as in conclusion, it is important to note).
- Humans rarely use repetitive structures unless stylistically intended.
1. Specificity:
- AI tends to generalize (such as "technology is rapidly advancing").
- Humans include personal experiences or context-rich details (such as "last summer during the bushfires in Victoria").
1. Complexity Balance:
- AI-generated text often has uniform sentence length and structure.
- Humans naturally mix short, medium, and long sentences.
1. Topical Coherence:
- AI text tends to be rigid and mechanically logical.
- Human text may have digressions, narrative flow, or conversational shifts.

*Part 2: Confidence Levels:*

- Level 50–60 (Low confidence): Weak indicators, mixed signals.
- Level 61–75 (Moderate confidence): Some strong signals, but ambiguity remains.
- Level 76–90 (Strong confidence): Clear indicators, consistent across features.
- Level 91–100 (Very strong confidence): Highly consistent with AI/Human patter.

*Part 3: Few-Shot Prompt*

**Goal:** Classify whether text is AI-generated or Human-written, give a confidence score, and explain reasoning across 5 dimensions.

**Format:**

{  "Label": "AI" | "Human",  

`   `"Confidence": "<0-100>",  

`   `"Reasoning": {    

"Stylistic fluency": "...",    

"Repetition patterns": "...",    

"Specificity": "...",    

"Complexity balance": "...",    

"Topical coherence": "..."}

}

- Example 1 (AI generic text): Label = AI.
- Example 2 (Human Writing): Label = Human.
- Example 3 (Uncertain generic statement): Label = AI, moderate confidence.
- A detection rated AI with 70% confidence must explain signals such as "Polished style, generic phrasing, uniform sentence structure."

*Part 4: Use Cases:*

**Case 1: Human text**

Prompts: “I had coffee this morning and read the news.”

Expected JSON Output:

{  "Label": "Human",  

`    `"Confidence": "85",  

`    `"Reasoning": {    

"Stylistic fluency": "Informal, conversational tone.",    

"Repetition patterns": "No unnatural repetition.",   "

Specificity": "Personal detail about morning activity, highly human-like.",    

"Complexity balance": "Simple but natural sentence structure.",    

"Topical coherence": "Flows naturally as a personal narrative."

` `}

}

**Case 2: AI-Generated Text**

Prompt: "ChatGPT is a large language model created by OpenAI."

Expected JSON Output:

{  "Label": "AI",  

`    `"Confidence": "88",  

`    `"Reasoning": {    

"Stylistic fluency": "Polished, formal definition style.",    

"Repetition patterns": "No unusual repetition, but definition-like phrasing.",    

"Specificity": "Generic and factual, no human perspective.",    

"Complexity balance": "Single declarative sentence, uniform structure.",    

"Topical coherence": "Flows logically, reads like an AI-generated definition."  

}

}
