5,"We recently ran a red team-blue team exercise. Our AI tools were excellent at identifying command-and-control traffic, but when it came to lateral movement, it was our experienced analysts who noticed the subtle signs. The AI was a force multiplier, not a silver bullet. That balance between automation and intuition is what makes modern cybersecurity truly effective.","1) Overall Summary:  
The submission shows a sound understanding of the roles AI and human analysts play in cybersecurity. The student effectively communicates a real-world scenario and reflects thoughtfully on the interplay between automation and human intuition. While the response is concise and insightful, expanding on specific AI technologies or challenges faced would further enrich the analysis.
