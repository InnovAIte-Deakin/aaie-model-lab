The text mentions the use of AI in monitoring user activity across a cloud environment and the catching of abnormal logins. This is a clear indication of AI being used in cybersecurity.\n2. However, the text also mentions that the AI raised false alarms that confused junior staff and needed to be trained and guided. This implies that human expertise was necessary to improve the AI's performance.\n3. The text emphasizes the collaboration between automation and intuition as what makes modern cybersecurity truly effective. This further reinforces the hybrid nature of the cybersecurity approach being described.\n\n=== Rubric-Aligned Feedback ===\n1) Overall Summary: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the role of firewalls and intrusion detection systems in network security.
