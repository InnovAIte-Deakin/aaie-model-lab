      "This submission demonstrates a basic understanding of early literacy development in the 3-6 age range, mentioning key skills like phonological awareness and print knowledge. However, it lacks depth in explaining developmental progression and fails to evaluate evidence-based approaches or consider diverse learners' needs.  The submission would benefit from expanding on the described skills and incorporating relevant research and examples.\n",
