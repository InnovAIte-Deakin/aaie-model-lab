        "This notebook is part of Phase 1 of the LLM Team’s experiment plan, evaluating DeepSeek-R1 on our base prompts and multi-domain datasets. The aim is to assess model suitability for two core tasks—AI/Human/Hybrid detection and rubric-aligned feedback—and to record latency and output quality for later model comparisons across phases.\n",

        "## Azure API Integration\n",
        "We integrate with Azure AI Inference using the azure-ai-inference SDK and our enterprise deployment endpoint. This provides governed access, reproducible runs, and clear cost/latency tracking while aligning with our security and compliance requirements. (The GPT-4.1 notebook uses Azure OpenAI; here we mirror the same experiment flow via Azure AI Inference for DeepSeek-R1.)\n",

        "\n",
        "## Experimental Goal\n",
        "The experimental goal is to run identical prompts across detection and feedback tasks for diverse student submissions drawn from engineering, accounting, IT, psychology, and teaching datasets. In doing so, we gather evidence of detection accuracy and consistency in distinguishing human, AI, and hybrid submissions. We also evaluate the usefulness and rubric alignment of feedback outputs, while measuring response time and token consumption. The information collected here is intended to become the basis for comparing DeepSeek-R1 with other models in subsequent phases."

But the assignment's prompt required three. So the student didn't follow instructions, which might fall under a different criterion, perhaps c4 (structure and academic writing) if the instructions were part of formatting. Or maybe it's part of the content. Hmm. The rubric's c1 says \"selected biases\" but the assignment required at least three. So if the student only did two, that's a failure to meet the assignment's requirements, which would impact the grade. But the rubric's c1 is about the understanding of the selected ones. So perhaps the student's understanding of the two is good, but the fact that they didn't include the third is a separate issue. However, the rubric's c1 might not penalize for the number, but the assignment prompt does. So maybe the number of biases is part of the assignment's scope, which would affect the criteria. For example, if the rubric's c1 is about the depth of understanding, but the student didn't cover enough biases, that might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe the number is part of the application (c2) since the application requires examples. But the assignment prompt says \"select at least three\" and the student did two, so that's a problem. So perhaps the c1 rating is lower because they didn't cover the required number, but the rubric's c1 is about comprehension, not quantity. This is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the number is part of the structure (c4) if the structure requires following the assignment's instructions. But the rubric's c4 is about writing quality, flow, citations, etc. So perhaps the student's failure to include three biases is a content issue, which would affect c1 and c2. For example, c1's conceptual understanding would require covering three biases as per the assignment. So if the student only did two, their conceptual understanding is incomplete. Therefore, c1 would be 'average' or 'needs_improvement\n",

The structure is very organized, each paragraph flows logically into the next. The use of specific strategies like dialogic reading and phonemic awareness games with citations (Justice & Ezell, 2002; Lonigan et al., 2008) is academic. Then it moves to adapting strategies for diverse learners, multilingual backgrounds, and developmental delays. The conclusion mentions peer-reviewed sources like Neuman and Wright (2014) and Snow (2006), and ends by stating the argument is evidence-based and academically rigorous.\n",

            "Looking at discourse features: The text is highly specific with technical terms and references. It's objective, no personal anecdotes or subjective statements.

The style is consistently formal, which is typical for academic writing but might be too polished. \n",

            "The text begins with a strong statement that literacy development doesn't need to start at school age, which is a common argument in early education. The mention of phonological awareness, vocabulary, and print understanding aligns with typical academic topics. The submission then outlines specific skills developed between ages 3 and 6, like recognizing letters and handling books. It also notes that around age four, children can rhyme simple words and recognize some letters. The conclusion ties these skills to later reading success.\n",

They mention developmental milestones (rhyming at four, letter recognition). So this seems good. But maybe they could have gone into more depth about specific milestones for each age within 3-6, not just age four. So maybe rating is good, not excellent. Improvement tip: Add more detailed milestones across the 3-6 range.\n",

            "c5: Structure and Academic Writing. The excerpt provided is a paragraph, but the full essay isn't here. However, the given part is well-structured with clear sentences. But since the prompt might require a full essay, and the submission is just a part, maybe the structure is incomplete. However, based on the provided text, the structure is logical. But academic style is maintained. However, the user might not have the full essay. Wait, the student submission is just that one paragraph. So if the entire submission is only that paragraph, then the structure is incomplete—no intro, body, conclusion. But the user's context says the assignment is an essay. So the student's work here is just a snippet. But the rubric's c5 is about the essay structure. If the student only wrote this paragraph, then structure is lacking. But maybe the user's context is that this is part of a longer essay. Hmm. The user provided the student submission as that paragraph. So assuming that's the entire submission, then structure is poor. But if it's part of a longer essay, maybe not. But given the info, the submission is just that paragraph. So c5 would be needs_improvement or poor. But the paragraph itself is well-written. So maybe structure is poor because it's just a body paragraph without intro or conclusion. But the writing is correct. So for c5, maybe Structure is poor (if the entire essay is just that), but Academic Writing is good. Wait, the rubric's c5 combines both structure and academic writing. So if the submission is only a paragraph, then structure is not present (no intro, body, conclusion), so rating would be poor. But the paragraph itself is well-structured. Hmm. The rubric says \"essay is logically structured with clear introduction, body, and conclusion\". If the submission is just a body paragraph, then structure is incomplete. So c5 would be poor. But the writing style is correct. So maybe the rating is average? Wait, the criteria combines structure and academic writing. If the structure is missing but the writing is good, maybe average. But the user's context says the assignment is an essay. If the student only submitted a paragraph, then structure is severely lacking. So c5 would be poor. But if the student's full essay is structured properly, but the user only provided a part, then we can't assess. Since the user provided the student submission as that paragraph, we have to assume that's the entire submission. So Structure and Academic Writing: the structure is non-existent as an essay, so poor. But the writing in the paragraph is correct. So maybe the rating is needs_improvement. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. The rubric's c5 says \"essay is logically structured with clear introduction, body, and conclusion; academic style maintained with correct grammar and syntax.\" If the submission is just a body paragraph, then the structure is not present. So the rating would be poor. But the writing within the paragraph is correct, so maybe academic style is good. But the structure is missing. So overall, c5, the rating would be poor.
