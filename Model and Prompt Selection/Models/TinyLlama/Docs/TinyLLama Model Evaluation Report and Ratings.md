# TinyLLama Model Evaluation Report

## AI Detection Performance: 2/5
### Critical Performance Issues
- Barely above random chance with overall performance showing systematic failures
- Severe bias toward Human classification consistently fails to identify AI-generated content
- High false negative rate most problematic for academic integrity applications where detecting AI use is essential
- Overconfident incorrect predictions shows poor calibration between confidence and accuracy
- Inconsistent domain performance â€” ranges from barely functional to completely unreliable across different academic fields

### Domain-Specific Weaknesses
- Teaching and Accounting domains show severe classification failures
- Only IT domain demonstrates marginally acceptable performance
- Model struggles particularly with Hybrid content detection

## Feedback Generation Performance: 1/5
### Fundamental System Failures
- Cannot execute basic task requirements fails to provide structured feedback as specified
- Output format violations returns rubric content instead of assessment feedback
- Incomplete response generation frequent text cutoffs and truncation issues
- Generic non-specific commentary lacks ability to provide actionable, targeted feedback
- Text generation degradation exhibits repetitive token patterns and coherence breakdown
- Complete inability to assess content against rubric criteria

## Overall Assessment
The TinyLLama model demonstrates critical limitations that render it unsuitable for educational assessment applications.

### Key Concerns
- AI detection reliability is insufficient for academic integrity purposes
- Feedback generation capability is fundamentally broken
- Model shows systematic biases that undermine its core functionality
- Performance inconsistency across domains makes it unreliable for diverse educational contexts

## Final Ratings
- AI Detection: 2/5 Poor performance with dangerous false negatives
- Feedback Generation: 1/5 Complete task failure
