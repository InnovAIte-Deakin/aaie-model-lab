        "This notebook is part of Phase 1 of the LLM Team’s experiment plan, where we test the GPT-4.1 model on our base prompt and data. The purpose is to evaluate its suitability and performance so we can select the best model for feedback generation and AI detection from our shortlisted options for the next phases.\n",

These results form the foundation for model comparison across domains and will guide the LLM Team’s decision for the optimal model moving forward."
