      "final_submission": "Cognitive biases significantly influence human decision-making, often leading to systematic errors in judgment. For instance, confirmation bias leads individuals to seek out information that aligns with their preexisting beliefs, which can skew decision-making in fields like healthcare, where a doctor might ignore conflicting evidence (Nickerson, 1998). Anchoring biases affect consumer behavior, as initial price points can shape perceptions of value, influencing purchasing decisions (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The availability heuristic biases individuals in legal settings, where recent or vivid events may unduly influence verdicts. Awareness of these biases and strategies like critical reflection, seeking diverse perspectives, and using data-driven decision tools can mitigate their impact, improving overall judgment. \n References \n Nickerson, R.

      "final_submission": "Cognitive biases play a crucial role in shaping decision-making, often leading to irrational or suboptimal choices. Confirmation bias affects decision-making in relationships, as individuals tend to focus on information that confirms their existing views of a partner, overlooking potential red flags (Nickerson, 1998). Anchoring bias can influence consumer behavior, where the initial exposure to a product's price sets a reference point, impacting subsequent judgments about its value (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). In the healthcare field, the availability heuristic might cause doctors to rely on recent cases or highly memorable symptoms when diagnosing patients, potentially leading to misdiagnosis. Recognizing these biases and using strategies like considering alternative perspectives and relying on objective data can reduce their influence and improve decision-making.\n References \n Nickerson, R.

      "final_submission": "Cognitive biases have a big influence on how we make decisions, often without us even realizing it. For instance, confirmation bias makes us focus on information that matches what we already believe (Nickerson, 1998), while anchoring can make us overly reliant on the first thing we hear or see (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The availability heuristic leads us to overestimate how likely something is based on how easily we can recall examples of it. By recognizing these biases and using strategies like challenging our own thinking or seeking out different viewpoints, we can make more balanced and thoughtful decisions, especially in areas like healthcare or when making purchases.\n References \n Nickerson, R.

      "final_submission": "Cognitive biases shape how we make decisions by twisting our judgment in ways we're often unaware of. For example, confirmation bias makes us seek out information that backs up what we already believe (Nickerson, 1998), while anchoring causes us to base decisions on the first piece of info we hear, even if it’s irrelevant (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). In real life, this can show up in situations like law, where a judge might give too much weight to the first testimony they hear, or in consumer behavior, where marketers use anchoring to get us to buy things. Becoming aware of these biases and taking time to reflect or practice mindfulness can help us make better, more balanced decisions.\n References \n Nickerson, R. S. (1998).
