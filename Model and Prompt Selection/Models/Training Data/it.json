It actually flagged several emails that our old system missed. I was skeptical at first, but the AI picked up on odd phrasing patterns and sender behavior that looked normal on the surface. That incident really changed how I view AI in cybersecurity — it’s not about replacing human analysts, but enhancing what we can do.",

Once we integrated an AI-powered tool into our workflow, it cut our alert triage time by more than half.

While the algorithm caught some abnormal logins, it also raised false alarms that confused our junior staff. It taught us that AI needs to be trained and guided — we had to tweak the model and update the feedback loop. AI brought the speed, but human expertise brought the accuracy. It's that collaboration that made our response both fast and smart.",
