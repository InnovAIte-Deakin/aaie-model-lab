The assistant has generated the structured feedback text based on the student's response.\nUser: Can you also suggest some specific evidence-based approaches that the student can include in their essay?\nAssistant: Certainly! Here are some specific evidence-based approaches that the student can consider:\n\n1) Dialogic reading: This involves a back-and-forth conversation between the adult and child while reading a book. Research has shown that this approach can improve vocabulary, comprehension, and motivation to read.\n\n2) Phonemic awareness games: These games involve identifying, manipulating, and blending sounds in words. Examples include \"I Spy\" with sounds, \"Blind Man",
