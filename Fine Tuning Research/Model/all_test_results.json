The grading rubric is vague, and it's challenging to determine the appropriate grade. A detailed description of how you arrive at a grade would be helpful.\n\nAs a Tester, I would suggest the following improvements:\n- Improve the grading rubric to make it clearer and more precise. For example, specify what constitutes insufficient evidence for each criterion, and what the minimum level of evidence is required for each performance level.\n- Provide specific examples of how you determined the grade for each criterion. This would increase transparency and help the assessor understand how the rubric was applied.\n- Consider adding a section for feedback on the student's writing style, organization, and academic tone.

The engineer then maps out the entire production workflow using tools like process flow diagrams and value stream maps. Equipment selection follows, guided by factors such as cycle time, required operations (e.g., stamping, injection molding, or robotic assembly), and automation level. The layout is optimized using CAD software to ensure minimal material handling, ergonomic access, and logical sequencing of operations\u2014commonly using a U-cell or straight-line arrangement. Efficiency is measured using takt time, OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), and line balancing strategies. Safety is addressed proactively via hazard analyses (FMEA), clear signage, guarding, PPE zones, and training procedures.
