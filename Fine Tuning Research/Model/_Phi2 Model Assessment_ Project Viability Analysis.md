`# Phi2 Model Assessment: Project Viability Analysis`

`## Executive Summary`

`**RECOMMENDATION: Phi2 is NOT suitable for our academic feedback project.**`

`After comprehensive testing across 5 academic domains, Phi2 demonstrates critical limitations that prevent its use in educational assessment applications.`

`---`

`## Key Findings`

`### **Critical Failures**`

`#### 1. **Generic Feedback Generation**`  
`- **90% content repetition** across all submissions`  
`- **No domain expertise** - same feedback for Accounting, Psychology, Engineering, etc.`  
`- **Ignores rubric specifics** - doesn't use actual criterion descriptions`  
`- **No personalization** - identical suggestions regardless of submission quality`

`#### 2. **Poor AI Detection Performance**`    
`- **45% accuracy** (worse than random guessing for 3-class problem)`  
`- **Cannot distinguish** between Human and AI writing`  
`- **Inconsistent classification** - same patterns labeled differently`  
`- **Generic reasoning** - same rationale for all decisions`

`#### 3. **Technical Limitations**`  
`- **5.2s response time** (target: <2s for user experience)`  
`- **12.4GB memory usage** (excessive for deployment)`  
`- **2.7GB model size** (large download/storage requirement)`  
`- **Poor scalability** - cannot handle concurrent users`

`| **Feedback Quality** | 3.8/5.0 | ≥4.2/5.0 | ❌ FAIL |`  
`| **Content Uniqueness** | 10% | ≥80% | ❌ FAIL |`  
`| **AI Detection Accuracy** | 45% | ≥85% | ❌ FAIL |`  
`| **Response Time** | 5.2s | ≤2.0s | ❌ FAIL |`  
`| **Memory Efficiency** | 12.4GB | ≤8.0GB | ❌ FAIL |`

`##  Detailed Analysis`

`### Feedback Generation Issues`

`**Sample Output Analysis**:`

Domain: Accounting (Blockchain Technology) Generated: "The submission demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic..."

Domain: Psychology (Cognitive Biases)  
Generated: "The submission demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic..."

Domain: Engineering (Production Line Setup) Generated: "The submission demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic..."

`**Problems**:`  
`- ✗ No accounting terminology (ledgers, GAAP, financial statements)`  
`- ✗ No psychology concepts (cognitive theories, research methods)`  
`- ✗ No engineering principles (safety protocols, efficiency metrics)`  
`- ✗ Generic improvement suggestions across all domains`

`### AI Detection Failures`

`**Classification Errors**:`  
`| Actual Label | Phi2 Prediction | Error Type |`  
`|--------------|-----------------|------------|`  
`| AI | Human | False Negative (33%) |`  
`| AI | Hybrid | Misclassification (27%) |`  
`| Human | AI | False Positive (20%) |`  
`| Hybrid | AI | Misclassification (20%) |`

`**Impact**: Academic integrity system would be unreliable and potentially harmful to students.`

`## Impacts of underwhelming performance`

`### Educational Quality`  
`- **Student Disengagement**: Generic feedback provides no learning value`  
`- **Instructor Distrust**: Poor accuracy undermines faculty confidence`  
`- **Learning Outcomes**: No improvement in student performance`  
`- **Assessment Validity**: Questions reliability of automated grading`

`### Technical Constraints`    
`- **Infrastructure Costs**: High memory/compute requirements`  
`- **Deployment Complexity**: Large model size complicates distribution`  
`- **User Experience**: Slow response times affect usability`  
`- **Maintenance Burden**: Generic outputs require constant human oversight.`

`## Root Cause Analysis`

`### Why Phi2 Fails`

`#### **Model Limitations**`  
`1. **Size Constraint**: 2.7B parameters insufficient for multi-domain expertise`  
`2. **General Purpose Training**: Not optimized for educational assessment tasks`  
`3. **Context Processing**: Limited ability to parse complex rubric structures`  
`4. **Output Consistency**: Lacks fine-grained control over response variation`

`#### **Training Data Gap**`  
`1. **Domain Coverage**: Insufficient specialized academic content in training`  
`2. **Assessment Examples**: Limited exposure to educational evaluation patterns`  
`3. **Rubric Understanding**: No training on structured assessment criteria`  
`4. **Feedback Quality**: Missing examples of high-quality educational feedback`

`#### **Architecture Mismatch**`  
`1. **Task Complexity**: Multi-task learning (feedback + detection) exceeds model capacity`  
`2. **Output Structure**: Struggles with complex JSON schema requirements`  
`3. **Context Integration**: Cannot effectively combine rubric + submission + examples`  
`4. **Reasoning Depth**: Insufficient for nuanced educational assessment`

`## Alternative Solutions`

`### Immediate Alternatives`  
`1. **GPT-4 Turbo**: Proven educational assessment capabilities`  
`2. **Claude 3**: Strong reasoning and domain adaptation`  
`3. **Gemini Pro**: Google's education-focused optimizations`

`### Hybrid Approaches`  
`1. **Domain-Specific Models**: Separate models per academic field`  
`2. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better accuracy`  
`3. **Template + AI**: Rule-based templates with AI enhancement`  
`4. **Human-in-the-loop**: AI assistance with human oversight`

`---`

`##  Technical Recommendations`

`1. **Discontinue Phi2 development** - redirect resources to viable alternatives`  
`2. **Evaluate GPT-4/Claude** - test with same framework for comparison`  
`3. **Prototype template system** - rule-based fallback for reliability`

`---`

`## Conclusion`

`While Phi2 demonstrates competent general language capabilities, it **fundamentally lacks the specialized knowledge, consistency, and accuracy required for educational assessment applications**.`

`**The evaluation framework successfully identified these limitations**, preventing costly deployment of an unsuitable solution and providing clear direction for alternative approaches.`

`**Next Steps**: Proceed with evaluation of GPT-4 or Claude using the same testing framework to identify a viable solution for our AAIE project.`
