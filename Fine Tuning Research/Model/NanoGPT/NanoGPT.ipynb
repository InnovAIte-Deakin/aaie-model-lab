            "- The submission exhibits a structured approach and technical terminology consistent with manufacturing engineering (e.g., \"takt time,\" \"feedback loops\"), which are common features of AI-generated content. However, the inclusion of human-like subjectivity and consideration for worker intuition (e.g., \"how intuitive the setup is for workers\") suggests personal contextualization likely contributed by a human writer.\n",
            "- Stylistically, the piece avoids excessive verbosity or purely formulaic explanations, showing signs of manual editing or human refinement overlaying an AI-generated draft. The prose includes nuanced phrasing (e.g., \"real-world testing and adaptation,\" \"key operations\") that evidence human input.\n",

            "Flags:\n",
            "- Slight stylistic detachment around technical terms (e.g., \"simulation software to predict performance under various conditions\") suggests partial AI assistance to bolster coherence and detail.\n",
