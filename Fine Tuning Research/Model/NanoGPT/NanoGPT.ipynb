Real-world examples such as Ernst & Young and JPMorgan are effectively integrated, offering clarity and relevance. While the analysis is insightful, further exploration of challenges and critical evaluation of blockchain’s limitations could strengthen the argument.\n",

      "Label: Human  \n",
      "Rationale:  \n",
      "- The submission displays features of personal, anecdotal tone, with simple sentence structures and limited technical terminology, typical of human-authored writing. It lacks extensive subject-specific jargon or stylistic markers of AI-generated text.  \n",
      "- The narrative includes practical, subjective touches like “talk with the designers” and “helps save time,” rather than adhering to highly formalized or algorithmic explanations. Coherence is local (step-by-step recounting), but lacks the advanced structure often seen in AI outputs. This simplicity and specificity indicate likely human authorship.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Flags:  \n",
      "- Not highly technical, potentially indicating lower academic depth than expected for the subject level. May need review for detail and rigor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Summary:**  \n",
      "The submission demonstrates an understanding of basic production line setup for a new consumer product, touching on important elements of design communication, equipment layout, efficiency, and safety. While the overview is functional, it lacks depth and detail in certain areas, particularly in technical reasoning and advanced insights into manufacturing processes. Greater clarity and specific examples would strengthen the response.\n",

      "- **Discourse features**: The submission is highly formal, technical, and generalized with no personal context or subjective insights, which aligns strongly with AI-generated content. It reads as an optimized explanation without human idiosyncrasies or nuances.\n",
      "- **Style consistency**: The text is uniformly polished and detailed throughout. It uses advanced terminology such as \"Gantt charts,\" \"takt time,\" \"cellular manufacturing,\" and \"non-value-adding steps,\" suggesting algorithmic overgeneralization and lack of practical, narratively variable explanation.\n",
      "- **Global/local coherence**: While the content is logical and well-structured, the precision and conciseness are too optimized to reflect typical human cognitive processes, which often include elaboration or occasional digression.\n",
      "- **Cliché patterns**: The text frequently employs systematically structured phrases found in technical writing (e.g., \"balancing cost with flexibility,\" \"data-driven adjustments\"), indicative of language model outputs.\n",
