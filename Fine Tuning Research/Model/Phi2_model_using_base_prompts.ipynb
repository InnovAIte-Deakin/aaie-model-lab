Equipment selection follows, guided by factors such as cycle time, required operations (e.g., stamping, injection molding, or robotic assembly), and automation level. The layout is optimized using CAD software to ensure minimal material handling, ergonomic access, and logical sequencing of operations—commonly using a U-cell or straight-line arrangement. Efficiency is measured using takt time, OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), and line balancing strategies.
