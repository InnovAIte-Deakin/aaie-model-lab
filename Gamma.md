\
\cb3 Gemma is a family of open-weight language models developed by Google DeepMind, optimized for both research and deployment in production environments. The models are lightweight, instruction-tuned, and designed for responsible open-weight use across tasks like text generation, reasoning, summarization, and code generation. Released in February 2024 and updated in June 2024 with Gemma 2, these models leverage the same technology as Google\'92s Gemini models.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Gemma 2 models are optimized for efficient inference and fine-tuning on modern hardware (consumer GPUs and TPUs). These models improve on Gemma 1 in terms of performance, multilingual understanding, and instruction following. There are two available sizes of Gemma: The key points of Gemma is,\cb1 \
\
\cb3 - Higher quality reasoning, code, and multilingual understanding\cb1 \
\cb3 - Enhanced fine-tuning efficiency and compatibility with multiple platforms (JAX, PyTorch, TensorFlow)\cb1 \
\cb3 - Released under a custom Gemma license that allows for commercial use with some limitations.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 The model Structure of Gemma 2 is below, with comparison to its sizes,\cb1 \
\
\cb3 |     | Gemma 2 \'96 2b | Gemma 2 \'96 7b |\cb1 \
\cb3 | --- | --- | --- |\cb1 \
\cb3 | Model size (parameters) | 2 billion | 7 billion |\cb1 \
\cb3 | Context window size | 8,192 tokens | 8,192 tokens |\cb1 \
\cb3 | Architecture type | Decoder-only transformer | Decoder-only transformer |\cb1 \
\cb3 | Target use case | Instruction, Reasoning, Dialogue, Coding | Same |\cb1 \
\
\cb3 ## Advantages\cb1 \
\
\cb3 - Fine-tuning for detection or feedback tasks is feasible.\cb1 \
\cb3 - Excellent at following structured prompts for feedback and explanation tasks.\cb1 \
\cb3 - Performs well with rubric-based, JSON-formatted.\cb1 \
\cb3 - Naturally suited to generating structured responses (scores, labels, explanations), feasible for consistent feedback or AI detection output.\cb1 \
\cb3 - Handles multiple languages.\cb1 \
\cb3 - Can be deployed for AAIE applications.x\cb1 \
\cb3 - Runs on Hugging Face, integrates with PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and supports deployment via vLLM, TGI, or Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.\cb1 \
\cb3 - Easily test prompts for zero-shot/few-shot detection or feedback without fine-tuning.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 ## Limitations\cb1 \
\
\cb3 - Not suitable for full-document analysis (e.g., long essays or research papers) without pre-summarization or chunking.\cb1 \
\cb3 - Out-of-the-box model not trained to detect AI-generated content, task-specific fine-tuning is required with labeled data (human vs AI).\cb1 \
\cb3 - Unlike Qwen 3, Gemma lacks native agent frameworks (e.g., for chaining tools, calling APIs, or multi-step workflows).\cb1 \
\cb3 - Cannot use Gemma to train new foundation models or competing large models (per the Gemma License).\cb1 \
\cb3 - The 2B model might underperform on nuanced detection tasks (e.g., style mimicry, deception), requiring extra training or prompt tuning.\
