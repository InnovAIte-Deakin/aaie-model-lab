## Detailed Reviewer Guide  

### 1. When Do I Review a PR?  

When someone creates a PR to add or update code, experiments, or documentation, they will request **at least two peer reviewers** and one senior lead reviewer.  

Your job is to check:  
- Is the PR description clear and complete?  
- Is the code structured, readable, and following conventions?  
- Are experiments reproducible (scripts, configs, datasets linked)?  
- Are results and evaluation metrics documented?  
- Does the change improve reliability without breaking existing workflows?

2. Click the **"Pull requests"** tab  
3. Find the PR you‚Äôve been assigned to review and open it

### 3. Read the Description  

At the top of the PR, you‚Äôll see a **title and description** explaining what the contributor changed.  
Read this carefully to understand what the PR is about (e.g., new model component, bug fix, evaluation update).

### 4. Review the Files
