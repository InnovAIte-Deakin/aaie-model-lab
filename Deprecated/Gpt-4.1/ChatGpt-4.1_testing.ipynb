Anchoring bias can influence consumer behavior, where the initial exposure to a product's price sets a reference point, impacting subsequent judgments about its value (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). In the healthcare field, the availability heuristic might cause doctors to rely on recent cases or highly memorable symptoms when diagnosing patients, potentially leading to misdiagnosis.

Children typically progress from recognizing environmental print and basic letter-sound associations at age 3 to developing phonemic segmentation and decoding skills by age 6. Evidence-based strategies such as dialogic reading and phonemic awareness games have proven highly effective in this stage, particularly when implemented consistently and in developmentally appropriate ways (Justice & Ezell, 2002; Lonigan et al., 2008). For instance, dialogic reading not only enhances vocabulary but also fosters narrative skills and inferencing abilities. Importantly, these approaches must be adapted for diverse learners. For children from multilingual backgrounds, integrating home languages and culturally relevant stories can enhance engagement and comprehension. Similarly, for children with developmental delays, visual supports and multisensory activities can scaffold learning. This inclusive lens ensures equitable access to literacy development. A wide range of peer-reviewed sources inform these practices, including Neuman and Wright (2014) on literacy equity and Snow (2006) on instructional responsiveness.

During this foundational period, children typically begin developing core pre-reading skills like phonological awareness, vocabulary knowledge, and an understanding of print concepts. Phonological awareness, in particular, is a strong predictor of later reading success. It includes the ability to recognize and manipulate sounds in spoken words, like rhyming or identifying beginning sounds. According to Lonigan et al. (2000), this skill emerges gradually, often starting with larger sound chunks (e.g. syllables) and becoming more refined over time (e.g. phonemes). The child rapidly acquires new vocabulary through exposure to rich language environments. He or she also starts to grasp print conventions by knowing that print carries meaning and how to handle a book.

Confirmation bias affects decision-making in relationships, as individuals tend to focus on information that confirms their existing views of a partner, overlooking potential red flags (Nickerson, 1998). Anchoring bias can influence consumer behavior, where the initial exposure to a product's price sets a reference point, impacting subsequent judgments about its value (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). In the healthcare field, the availability heuristic might cause doctors to rely on recent cases or highly memorable symptoms when diagnosing patients, potentially leading to misdiagnosis.

Children typically progress from recognizing environmental print and basic letter-sound associations at age 3 to developing phonemic segmentation and decoding skills by age 6. Evidence-based strategies such as dialogic reading and phonemic awareness games have proven highly effective in this stage, particularly when implemented consistently and in developmentally appropriate ways (Justice & Ezell, 2002; Lonigan et al., 2008). For instance, dialogic reading not only enhances vocabulary but also fosters narrative skills and inferencing abilities. Importantly, these approaches must be adapted for diverse learners. For children from multilingual backgrounds, integrating home languages and culturally relevant stories can enhance engagement and comprehension. Similarly, for children with developmental delays, visual supports and multisensory activities can scaffold learning. This inclusive lens ensures equitable access to literacy development. A wide range of peer-reviewed sources inform these practices, including Neuman and Wright (2014) on literacy equity and Snow (2006) on instructional responsiveness.
